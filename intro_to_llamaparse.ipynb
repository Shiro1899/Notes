Lift and bring down panels at its horizontal sides. Lifting may require two to three persons for longer panels.\\n2.      Panels should be stored in dry, shaded and good ventilated area. Avoid contact with wet lumber, soil or chemical contamination. Provide cover if not for\\n        immediate use.\\n3.      When panels become wet during storage, separate without delay, remove surface moisture with clean cloth and stack so air can circulate and complete the drying\\n        process.\\n4.      Panels should be piled over a pallet 10 cm from ground level and an inclination of 10° minimum.\\n5.      Roof structures and frames must be properly anchored.\\n6.      The spacing of the purlins must conform to the module distance required for the profile. Ensure that all purlins are in one planes and levelled.\\n7.      Adjust purlins at the gutter eaves line by considering the thickness of the fascia board to be used.\\n8.      Gutters must be installed first prior to the installation of roof panels.\\n9.      always align the panels before anchoring to the purlins. For te proper alignment of panels, make sure that the first panel to be laid out properly aligned with the\\n        gutter line. Run a string from the edge of the first panel laid out across the last panel to be installed, align and fasten all the rest of the panels using the string line\\n        reference.\\n10.     During installation, use rubber soled shoes and always step on or near the purlins to minimize indentations and prevent leakage due to it.\\n11.

Lift and bring down panels at its horizontal sides. Lifting may require two to three persons for longer panels.\\n2.       Panels should be stored in dry, shaded and good ventilated area. Avoid contact with wet lumber, soil or chemical contamination. Provide cover if not for\\n         immediate use.\\n3.       When panels become wet during storage, separate without delay, remove surface moisture with clean cloth and stack so air can circulate and complete the drying\\n         process.\\n4.       Panels should be piled over a pallet 10 cm from ground level and an inclination of 10° minimum.\\n5.       Roof structures and frames must be properly anchored.\\n6.       The spacing of the purlins must conform to the module distance required for the profile. Ensure that all purlins are in one planes and levelled.\\n7.       Adjust purlins at the gutter eaves line by considering the thickness of the fascia board to be used.\\n8.       Gutters must be installed first prior to the installation of roof panels.\\n9.       always align the panels before anchoring to the purlins. For te proper alignment of panels, make sure that the first panel to be laid out properly aligned with the\\n         gutter line. Run a string from the edge of the first panel laid out across the last panel to be installed, align and fasten all the rest of the panels using the string line\\n         reference.\\n10.      During installation, use rubber soled shoes and always step on or near the purlins to minimize indentations and prevent leakage due to it.\\n11.      Always clean-off debris such as fasteners, rivets, metal filings, metal cuttings and other metallic pieces every each day of installation.\\n12.      Minimize use of touch-up paint.\\n       UNION ROLLFORMING PLANT NORTH LUZON    SAN NICOLAS SALES OFFICE                MAI    PLANT AND        SOUTH LUZON     BATANGAS                           CAGAYAN DE ORO  NORTHWESTERN MINDANAO   OZAMIS SALES OFFICE\\n   Pcio PL , San Fernanca Cily;               Brgy: 12, San Cayetano , San            HEAO OFFICE                             ROLLFORMING PLANT                  ROLLFORMING PLANT                       Rizal Ave   Lam-an\\n      Union                                   Nicolas, llocos Norte                   Chipeco Avenue    Extension Brgy:       Brgy: Soro-Soro, Karsada,          Cor   Malasag Road Zone -               Ozamis City\\n   (072) 242.-0331/32                         (077) 770-3773                          Real, Calamba City, Laguna              Batangas City                       Cuqman    Cagayan De Oro City          (088) 521-5002,\\n   +63 923-829-0058                           +63 922-411-4141                        (02) 8520-8822                          +63 922-386-1749                   (088) 855.1563,                               521.4538\\n   BENGUET SALES OFFICE                       PANGASINAN SALES OFFICE                 Globe +63 917-503-3965,                                                    (088) 855-1884                          +63 917-777-0898\\n   Palmaville, Puguis; LaTrinidad,            Brgy: Nalsian; Calasiao.

Lift and bring down panels at its horizontal sides. Lifting may require two to three persons for longer panels.\\n2.      Panels should be stored in dry, shaded and good ventilated area. Avoid contact with wet lumber, soil or chemical contamination. Provide cover if not for\\n        immediate use.\\n3.      When panels become wet during storage, separate without delay, remove surface moisture with clean cloth and stack so air can circulate and complete the drying\\n        process.\\n4.      Panels should be piled over a pallet 10 cm from ground level and an inclination of 10° minimum.\\n5.      Roof structures and frames must be properly anchored.\\n6.      The spacing of the purlins must conform to the module distance required for the profile. Ensure that all purlins are in one planes and levelled.\\n7.      Adjust purlins at the gutter eaves line by considering the thickness of the fascia board to be used.\\n8.      Gutters must be installed first prior to the installation of roof panels.\\n9.      always align the panels before anchoring to the purlins. For te proper alignment of panels, make sure that the first panel to be laid out properly aligned with the\\n        gutter line. Run a string from the edge of the first panel laid out across the last panel to be installed, align and fasten all the rest of the panels using the string line\\n        reference.\\n10.     During installation, use rubber soled shoes and always step on or near the purlins to minimize indentations and prevent leakage due to it.\\n11.     Always clean-off debris such as fasteners, rivets, metal filings, metal cuttings and other metallic pieces every each day of installation.\\n12.     Minimize use of touch-up paint.\\n  LA UNION ROLLFORMING PLANT NORTH LUZON    SAN NICOLAS SALES OFFICE               MAIN PLANT ANO          SOUTH LUZON     BATANGAS                           CAGAYAN DE ORO NORTHWESTERN MINDANAO   OZAMIS SALES OFFICE\\n  Poro Ptsan    Femando City;               Brgy: 12, San Cayetan?.San             HEAD OFFICE                             ROLLFORMING PLANT                  ROLLFORMING PLANT                      Aiza       Lam-an;\\n La Union                                   Nicolas Ilccos Norte                    Chipeco Avenue Extensiom    Brgy       Brgy: Soro       Kansaca           Ccr Malasng Road Zone                  Ozamis City\\n (072) 242 0331/32                          (077) 770.3773                          Puall Calamba  City: Laguna            Batangas City                      Cugman, Cagayan De Oro Cily            (088) 521-5002,\\n  +63 923-829-0058                          +63 922-411-4141                       (02) 8520-8822 -                        763 922-386-1749                   (088) 855-1563                         (088) 521-4998\\n  BENGUET SALES OFFICE                      PANGASINAN SALES OFFICE                 Globe +83 917-503-3965                                                    (088) 855-1684                         +83 917-777-0898\\n  Palmaville Puguis, LaTrinidad;            Brgy: Nalsian , Calasiao,              Sman +63 919-003-2303                                                      463 906-875-5883\\n  Benguet                                   Pangasinan                              QUEZON WAREHOUSE                       BICOL                              ZAMBOANGA\\n (074) 665-8685                             (075) 523-9793, (075) 517-3970          Purok Vang  Ilang   Brgy:              ROLLFORHING PLANT                  ROLLFORMING PLANT\\n  +63 906.568 5301                              921-984-4288                       SilanganHayao     Lucena City           Princeton Warehouse                LB Ccmpound,    Veteran'\\n  BANTAY SALES OFFICE                       VILLASIS SALES OFFICE                  +63 923-839-8073                        JCse       Camarines Sur               ane Zamboanga City\\n  Brgy , Puspus, Bantay;Moco?

                             HANDLING, STORAGE AND INSTALLATION GUIDELINES\\n\\n\\n\\n1.      Lift and bring down panels at its horizontal sides from the truck or loading vehicle. Lifting may require two to three persons for longer panels.\\n2.      Panels should be stored in dry, shaded, and well-ventilated area. Avoid storing them with wet lumber, soil, or chemicals. If not for immediate use,\\n        provide proper cover or protection.\\n3.      When panels get wet, wipe off any surface moisture with a clean cloth, and stack them in a way that allows air to circulate and facilitate the drying\\n        process.\\n4.      Panels should be piled over a pallet 10 cm from ground level and an inclination of 10° minimum.\\n5.      Roof structures and frames must be properly anchored.\\n6.      The spacing of the purlins must conform to the module distance required for the profile to be installed. Ensure that all purlins are in one plane and\\n        levelled.\\n7.      Adjust purlins at the gutter eaves line by considering the thickness of the fascia board to be used.\\n8.      Gutters must be installed first prior to the installation of roof panels.\\n9.      Always align the panels before anchoring to the purlins. For the proper alignment of panels, make sure that the first panel is aligned with the gutter line.\\n        Run a string from the edge of the first panel laid out across the last panel to be installed, align and fasten all the rest of the panels using the string line\\n        reference.\\n10.     During installation, use rubber soled shoes and always step on or near the purlins to minimize indentations which may cause the system to leak.\\n11.     Always clean-off debris such as fasteners, rivets, metal filings, metal cuttings and other metallic pieces every after each day of installation.\\n12.     Minimize use of touch-up paint.

Since there is an overhang of 5cm at the eaves, the distance between the first and second purlin is 27cm, centre to centre.\\n\\nStart installation at eave, in pe opposite direction of pe prevailing wind. Position pe Slim cap can be used for pitches up to 30°. Above pat limit, pe standard ridge piece should be used. Thanks to pe higher pitch, pe apron piece is not necessary and pe ridge is watertight.\\nThe corrugated ventilated filler can be fixed below pe ridge piece, in order to prevent birds or oper animals entering into pe roof space. Overlap between ridges needs to be maintained at 15cm.\\n\\n## Product Characteristics\\n\\n|Length|107 cm|\\n|---|---|\\n|Width|40 cm|\\n|Thickness|3 mm|\\n|Height of Corrugation|38 mm|\\n|Pitch of Module|195 mm|\\n|Gross Surface|0.43 m^2|\\n|Weight of Product|1.3 kg|\\n|Weight per gross surface|3.1 kg/m^2|\\n|Corrugation + Flats|6 + 5|\\n\\n## Fixing\\n\\nONDUVILLA® is to be fixed at each overlap and corrugation with ONDUVILLA® fasteners. Fix the tiles following the order described above, between the 2 overlapping guides. Do not fix those corrugations that will be overlapped by the next tile or verge piece.\\n\\n## Ridges\\n\\nEnsure that the maximum distance from the ridge point to the next purlin is 15 cm. If necessary, add an extra purlin to maintain this distance.\\n\\n## Valley\\n\\nPrepare the support. Fix the screws on top of corrugations, into the supporting batten.\\n\\n## Side wall Abutment\\n\\nFix the tile to the side wall with an aluminium Z-profile. Secure the watertightness with a silicone mastic.\\n\\n## Accessories\\n\\nOnduline RIDGES 900mm x 420mm\\nLarge and flexible ridge piece which is needed for roofs wip pitch above 30 degrees.
